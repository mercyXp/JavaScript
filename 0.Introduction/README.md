# INTRODUCTION TO JAVASCRIPT

- Today's world of websites is hard to imagine without the JavaScript language. JavaScript is what makes the web pages that we view every day in our web browser live.

## General Overview

### Creation & Origin:

- Created in 1995 by Brendan Eich at Netscape as a scripting language for Netscape Navigator 2.
- Originally called LiveScript, renamed to JavaScript to leverage Java's popularity.
- Common confusion: Java and JavaScript are entirely different languages.

### Initial Features:

- Limited functionality, primarily for adding interactivity to web pages (e.g., button clicks, control actions).

### Modern Usage:

- Grown with HTML5 and Node.js, enabling broader applications:
- Client-side: Enhanced web applications.
- Server-side: Processes server requests (replacing PHP, ASP.NET, etc.).
- Desktop apps: Frameworks like Electron.
- Mobile apps: Supported by increased device power and HTML5.
- Embedded devices: Programming IoT (Internet of Things) devices.

### Popularity:

- Used widely across various domains, making it one of the most popular programming languages.

### Standardization:

- Early browser implementations varied, leading to the ECMAScript standard by ECMA organization.
- ECMAScript and JavaScript are largely interchangeable terms.
- Latest standard: ECMAScript 2023, published in June 2023.

### Challenges:
- Slow adoption of new standards by browsers.
- Compatibility issues with older browser versions.

### Development Tools:

- **Text Editors**: Recommended - Visual Studio Code (free, cross-platform, supports syntax highlighting).
- **Interpreter**: A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) can execute JavaScript code.
- **Development Environments**: Tools like Visual Studio, WebStorm, and NetBeans can simplify JavaScript development but are optional.

### Key Characteristics:

- Interpreted Language: Code is executed by an interpreter in the browser.

### Development Basics:
- Essential tools: Text editor and a web browser.
- Advanced tools/environments are optional for simplifying development.
